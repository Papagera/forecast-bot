"""Canonicalize URLs so trivially-different links collapse to one dedup key.

Every capture of a page is grouped under ``url_hash`` (see :mod:`models`).
Historically that hashed the *raw* URL string, so ``…/x``, ``…/x/``,
``…/x?utm_source=…`` and ``…/x#frag`` were four different "sources" — inflating
both storage and any "how many sources have we covered" count.

This module normalizes away differences that do **not** change *which page* you
get, so the dedup key is stable across those variants:

  - lowercase scheme + host, strip a default port (``:80`` / ``:443``)
  - drop the fragment (``#…``)
  - drop known analytics / click-tracking query params, then sort the rest
  - normalize a trailing slash (``…/x/`` -> ``…/x``; root collapses to no path)

It is deliberately conservative. It does **not** upgrade ``http`` -> ``https`` or
strip ``www.``: those can resolve to genuinely different pages on some hosts, so
collapsing them belongs to a later, opt-in phase (see ``ROADMAP.md``).
