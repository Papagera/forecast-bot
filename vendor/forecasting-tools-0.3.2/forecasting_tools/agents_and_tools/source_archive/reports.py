"""Persist each capture run's per-URL outcomes under ``reports/`` (nested per
:mod:`layout`; reads also pick up legacy flat ``reports/<run_id>.json`` keys).

The coverage report's job is to surface sources we should be collecting. A cited
source we have not archived falls into two very different buckets:

- **never fetched** — it was harvested into a manifest but no capture run ever
  attempted it. This is the real "we should go collect this" signal.
- **fetched but failed** — we tried and the fetch/quality gate rejected it
  (Cloudflare, PDF, 404…). A capture problem, not a collection problem.

Without persisted run outcomes the two are indistinguishable. Writing each run's
outcomes here lets coverage tell them apart.
