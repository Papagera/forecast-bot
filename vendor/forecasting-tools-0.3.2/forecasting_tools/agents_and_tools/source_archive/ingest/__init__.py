"""Ingestion: discover the URLs a bot cited and turn them into a manifest.

The capture pipeline needs a citation manifest as input. These helpers build one
from a bot's published reasoning:

  - :mod:`url_extraction` — pull URLs out of free text / markdown.
  - :mod:`trace_extraction` — build a manifest from a traced bot run (fullest path).
